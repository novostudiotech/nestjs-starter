# NestJS Starter Boilerplate

**Production-ready NestJS boilerplate**

A minimal, opinionated starting point for building NestJS backends intended to run in production.

## Principles

### Production-first
Everything here is designed to run in production environments. No experimental features, no half-baked integrations. Every dependency and configuration choice has been battle-tested.

### Minimal surface area
Only essential setup is included. No bloat, no kitchen sink. You get structured logging, type-safe validation, API documentation, and quality tooling—nothing more, nothing less.

### Explicit over implicit
Configuration and behavior are visible and easy to reason about. No magic, no hidden abstractions. If something happens, you know where and why.

### Long-term maintainability
The project should still make sense after months or years. Clear patterns, consistent conventions, and well-documented decisions ensure the codebase remains approachable.

## What's Included

- [x] **[Zod validation](docs/zod-validation.md)** with [`nestjs-zod`](https://github.com/risenforces/nestjs-zod) for type-safe request validation
- [x] **Pino logger** for structured, production-grade logging
- [x] **Swagger/OpenAPI** documentation auto-generated from your code
- [x] **Health checks** with `@nestjs/terminus` for monitoring application status
- [x] **Prometheus metrics** for observability and monitoring
- [x] **TypeORM** setup ready for PostgreSQL integration
- [x] **[Playwright E2E tests](docs/playwright-tests.md)** for API testing with auto-server management
- [x] **Biome** for fast, consistent linting and formatting
- [x] **Git hooks** via Husky for automated quality checks
- [x] **Commitlint** for conventional commit messages
- [x] **Lint-staged** for efficient pre-commit validation
- [x] **EditorConfig** for consistent coding style across editors
- [x] **pnpm** for fast, disk-efficient package management

## Example Module

This boilerplate includes a `Products` module (`src/products/`) as a **demonstration example** showing:
- Zod validation with various data types (strings, numbers, booleans, enums, arrays, nested objects)
- Different authorization decorators (`@AllowAnonymous()` for public routes, protected routes requiring authentication)
- Query parameter validation (pagination, filtering, sorting)
- Body parser testing (POST/PUT/PATCH with JSON)
- Error handling patterns (400, 401, 404)
- Complete E2E test coverage

⚠️ **Important:** This module is for demonstration purposes only. **Delete it before starting your actual development** to avoid confusion and keep your codebase clean.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+ 
- pnpm 10+
- PostgreSQL (optional, for database features)

### Installation

<!-- remove_after_init_start -->
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:novostudiotech/nestjs-starter.git my-project
cd my-project


pnpm install
pnpm init-project # Run initialization wizard
```

The wizard will:
- Ask for project details (name, slug, description, author)
- Show preview of all changes before applying
- Set up database (local Docker or custom connection)
- Generate AUTH_SECRET automatically
- Create and configure .env file
- Replace boilerplate names with your project names
- Initialize fresh git repository with new origin
- Install dependencies and run migrations (optional)
- Clean up boilerplate files

After initialization:
<!-- remove_after_init_end -->

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values
```

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode with watch
pnpm dev

# Production build and run
pnpm build
pnpm start:prod
```

The application will be available at:
- API: `http://localhost:3000`
- Swagger docs: `http://localhost:3000/docs`
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- Metrics: `http://localhost:3000/metrics`

## Commit Standards

This project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear, structured commit history:

```bash
# format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

feat(auth): add JWT token refresh
fix(users): resolve email validation bug
docs(readme): update installation steps
```

Commitlint validates all commit messages automatically via Git hooks.
